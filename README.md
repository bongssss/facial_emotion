```markdown
# 😊 Real-Time Face & Emotion Recognition

## 🔎 Overview
This project is a **deep learning system for face & emotion recognition**.  
It detects faces from a webcam feed and classifies emotions (happy, sad, neutral, angry, etc.).

## ✨ Features
- Real-time face detection (OpenCV).
- Emotion classification with CNN/ResNet.
- Overlay bounding boxes + labels.
- Logs emotions with timestamps.
- Web interface for live demo.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python, PyTorch, OpenCV
- FastAPI backend
- React / Streamlit frontend

## 🚀 How It Works
1. Video stream is captured.
2. Faces detected with Haar Cascades/DNN.
3. CNN predicts emotion category.
4. Results overlayed live.
5. Logs saved in CSV/DB.

## 📊 Example
**Input:** Webcam feed  
**Output:** Bounding box with label `"Happy"`

## 📸 Screenshots
(Add video stills of detection)

## 🧑‍💻 Installation
```bash
git clone <repo>
cd emotion-recognition
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload
